# profile-widget
<p>This project uses Google Form generated content to populate Javascript fields to profile people on a website. Both the widget and the full profile web site accordion are automatically updated when new content is added to the Google Sheet. The widget cycles through all possible profiles.</p>
<p>The <strong>GS Script</strong> file is the code that goes in the Google Sheet script editor.</p>
<p>The <strong>Profile Widget</strong> can go in the sidebar and show a preview of a profile. It will link to the complete profile on the Profile page.</p>
<p>The <strong>Profile Page</strong> is for the archive page with all complete profiles.</p>
